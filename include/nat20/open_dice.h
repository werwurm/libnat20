 *
 * The key usage flags are defined in RFC5280 Section 4.2.1.3,
 * however, they are expressed in a different bit order here
 * following the OpenDICE specification for CWTs (CBOR web tokens).
 *
 * OpenDICE places Bit 0 (DigitalSignature) at the least significant bit
 * in the first byte.
 *
 * This is in contrast to X509 certificates where the key usage bits
 * are expressed as a ASN.1 BIT STRING, which index bits from most to least
 * significant, e.g., Bit 0 (DigitalSignature) would be the most significant bit.
 *
 * The choice for using the OpenDICE CWT bit ordering over X509's was made
 * to optimize for the former. The CWT implementation turns out compacter
 * than the X509 variant also supported by libnat20. So X509 implementation
 * will have to eat the overhead of reversing the bit order before encoding.
