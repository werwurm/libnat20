 *
 * Note that in the current implementation, each call to this function
 * returns the same context and does not allocate new resources.
 * The `close` counterpart is a no-op.

 * and reentrant it is still possible to write code that
 * instantiates multiple contexts and closes them.
 *
 * This behavior is subject to change in the future and must
 * not be relied upon by the caller. For a single context instance,
 * no thread-safety guarantees may be assumed.
 *
 * @param ctx A pointer to the context to be opened.
