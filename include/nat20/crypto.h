     * However, it is impossible to meaningfully recover from this error, therefore,
     * it is strongly discouraged for implementations to return this error,
     * and given the nature of the algorithms, it should never be necessary to do so.
     *
     * ## Design rationale
     *
     * The API uses a one shot paradigm to allow implementations to hide resource
     * and state management from the caller, i.e., the libnat20 DICE service functionality.
     * The latter is expected to operate in a context where dynamic memory allocation
     * might not be available or desirable, and allocating memory for a digest context
     * would be a burden for the implementation, especially if the context size
     * depends on the implementation of this interface.
     *
     * This requires the entire message to be in memory at the time of the call.
     * The gather list is a trade off that allows the caller to composite a message without
     * needing to allocate a contiguous buffer for the entire message.
     *
     * This falls short when part of the message is already supplied as a gather list
     * as is the case if HMAC is implemented in terms of this digest function.
     * Allocating a new gather list is not feasible if no dynamic memory allocation
     * is possible. Also, the length of the new gather list cannot be anticipated.
     * Nesting of gather lists could have been chosen as a solution, but it would
     * introduce potentially unbounded stack growth.
     *
     * The choice to support an array of gather lists is a compromise that allows
     * HMAC implementation to compose a message provided as a gather list with the
     * key as a fixed size array of two gather lists that can be placed on the stack.
     * While not completely generic, it allows for all anticipated use cases required by
     * the libnat20 DICE service functionality.
     *
     * @param ctx The crypto context.
     * @param alg_in Designates the desired digest algorithm.
     * @param msg_in The message that is to be digested.
     * @param msg_count The number of gather lists in the @p msg_in array.
     * @param digest_out A buffer with sufficient capacity to hold
     *        @p digest_size_in_out (on input) bytes or NULL.
     * @param digest_size_in_out On input the capacity of the given buffer.
     *        On output the size of the digest.

     * Deterministically, derive a key from @p key_in - an opaque key

     * @p context_in - a caller supplied context.
     *
     * No specific implementation is required by this specification.
     * However, the implementation must be sufficiently robust in
     * that it must not leak information about the underlying secret
     * and the derived key or allow inferences about either key bits.
     *
     * Implementations need not guarantee that the underlying key
     * material is hidden from the caller through system architectural
     * measures.
     * However, this crypto API never requires exposure of the underlying
     * key material, so that implementations that delegate cryptographic
     * operations to an isolated service or secure element are feasible
     * and encouraged.

     * Implementations must support the derivation of CDIs as well
     * as key pairs for ed25519, SECP-256R1, and SECP-384R1.
