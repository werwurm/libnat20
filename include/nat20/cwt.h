/**
 * @brief Convert Open DICE public key information to COSE key format.
 *
 * If either argument is NULL this function is a no-op.
 *
 * If the @p key_info->algorithm is not supported, @p cose_key will be left unmodified.
 *
 * Supported algorithms are Ed25519, P-256, and P-384 which are expressed
 * by @ref n20_crypto_key_type_ed25519_e, @ref n20_crypto_key_type_secp256r1_e,
 * and @ref n20_crypto_key_type_secp384r1_e respectively.
 *
 * The function sets the algorithm ID to @ref n20_cose_algorithm_id_eddsa_e,
 * @ref n20_cose_algorithm_id_es256_e, or @ref n20_cose_algorithm_id_es384_e
 * respectively. Note that these values have been deprecated according to [1]
 * but are still in use.
 *
 * The function also populates the public key from the the supplied buffer
 * in @p key_info->key.
 *
 * In the case of P-256 and P-384, the function assumes that the key buffer
 * is formatted as an uncompressed EC point. If the buffer size is odd it
 * is assumed that the first byte is the format header `0x04` which gets ignored.
 * The point is then split into its X and Y coordinates and stored in
 * @p cose_key->x and @p cose_key->y respectively. @p cose_key->d is set to an
 * empty slice.
 *
 * In the case of ED25519, the function expects the key buffer to be in the
 * standard format for EdDSA keys and stores in @p cose_key->x.
 * @p cose_key->y and @p cose_key->d are set to empty slices.
 *
 * Buffers are not copied. Both @p key_info and @p cose_key point to the
 * same underlying buffers. No ownership transfer is implied. The buffers
 * must remain valid for the life time of both structures.
 *
 * [1] https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml
 *
 * @param cose_key Pointer to the COSE key structure to populate.
 * @param key_info Pointer to the Open DICE public key information.

/**
 * @brief Render a CBOR web token (CWT) structure.
 *
 * This function encodes a CWT (RFC8392) structure into a CBOR representation
 * including the issuer and subject claims, the subject public key and the OpenDICE
 * claims as described in the OpenDICE specification [1].
 *
 * The function never fails, however, the stream needs to be checked
 * for buffer @ref n20_stream_hash_buffer_overflow (or write position overflow
 * @ref n20_stream_has_write_position_overflow if the to-be-rendered size is measured)
 * after the call to ensure that it was rendered to the buffer successfully.
 *
 * The function is not responsible for managing the lifetime of the buffers
 * used by the input parameters. The caller must ensure that these buffers
 * remain valid for the duration of the function call.
 *
 * The function does not sanitize the input and may not produce a valid CWT.
 * E.g. if the key info is missing, or if the key algorithm is not supported.
 * the public key field will be rendered as a CBOR null value
 * @sa n20_cwt_key_info_to_cose.

 * [1] https://pigweed.googlesource.com/open-dice/+/HEAD/docs/specification.md
