/**
 * @brief Renders the value of a TCG DICE TCB Freshness X509 extension.
 *
 * The function expects a pointer to an instance of
 * @ref n20_slice_t as @p context argument.
 *
 * If @p context is NULL, or if @p context->buffer is NULL, nothing is rendered,
 * which would leave the resulting TCG DICE TCB Freshness extension malformed.
 *
 * (See TCG DICE Attestation Architecture Version 1.1, Section 6.3.)
 * @sa OID_TCG_DICE_TCB_FRESHNESS
 * This function is typically not used directly but instead
 * passed to @ref n20_x509_extension by initializing an
 * instance of @ref n20_x509_extensions_t
 * (See @ref n20_x509_extension for an example).
