/**
 * @defgroup SHA SHA-2 Hash Functions
 * @brief Functions for computing SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 hashes.
 *
 * These functions implement the SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash functions as defined in
 * the NIST FIPS 180-4 specification. The implementation deviates from the specification
 * for SHA-384 and SHA-512 in that the maximum supported message size is limited to 2^64 bits.
 *
 * @see https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf
 *
 * # Usage Example
 * The following example demonstrates how to compute a SHA-256 hash using the provided functions.
 * @code{.c}
 *   n20_sha224_sha256_state_t state = n20_sha256_init();
 *   uint8_t data[] = "Hello, World!";
 *   n20_sha256_update(&state, data, sizeof(data) - 1);
 *   uint8_t digest[32];
 *   n20_sha256_finalize(&state, digest);
 *   // The digest now contains the SHA-256 hash of the input data.
 * @endcode
 *
 * @{
